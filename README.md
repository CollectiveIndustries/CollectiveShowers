Originaly this plug was by Gluzzer Based on SimplyNova Scheme, However after testing it out i found a lot of things i didnt like. Namely it assumed that your CPU was a Sigle Socket CPU for Rackmounded Servers and some Desktop boards there are multi Socket CPUs this will set things up for those in hopefully an easer way of expanding Cores and Sockets by renaming a few varables after the main configuration is done.
The Second thing about this plugin i didnt like was the bars i like Histograms to show a detailed picture of what my system has been running over a period of time, however its not as detailed as say Nagios or some other hardware monitoring solution but this should get the job done
